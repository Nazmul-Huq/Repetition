Inheritance in java is one of the pillars of OOP, which allows one class to inherit or use variables and methods of another class.
The class that inherits from another class can be called a subclass and the class from where it inherits is called a superclass.
This inheritance mechanism can be compared with real-life relation between parents and children, where children inherit property from their parents. Then they can use it directly or can modify it according to their need.
The main advantage of inheritance is code reusability, so we do not need to write the same code multiple times.
To be able to inherit from one class to another, there have to be some common features (variables and/or methods) between two classes.
Inheritance in java is achieved by the keyword "extends".
Then parent classe's constructor is used by using the keyword "super"
