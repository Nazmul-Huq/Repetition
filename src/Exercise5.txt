In the main method:
    a for loop is running 10 times
    each time the for loop run, it initiates an int variable called "random"
    assign a random value to "random" by calling a method "generateRandomInteger"
        method "generateRandomInteger":
            generate a value between 0 and 9, as its bound is 10
            then return the generated value
    print the value
    when for loop is done running: print a message
