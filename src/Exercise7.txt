The static keyword in java is a non-access modifier.
Static variable:
    When different objects have one common property, then a static keyword is used.
    Then all objects have access to that variable.
    For example, during making an employee database, all employees have common property i.e. company name
    Therefore it is wise to declare company name static.
    A static variable is also used to count the number of instances or objects created of a particular class.
Static method:
    A method is declared as static so that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class
    Therefore a static method can be accessed from outsides of the class by calling the class directly followed by method name
